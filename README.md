Chrome extension to view your Airtel connection's data usage
===

Why isn't this on the Chrome Web Store?
---

Because Chrome has started charging $5 as "[developer registration](https://support.google.com/chrome_webstore/answer/187591?hl=en&ref_topic=1212368)". I can't be bothered to either register or to spend $5.

Installation
---

1. [Download the zip](https://github.com/rakeshpai/airtel-chrome-extension/archive/master.zip) and extract it into a suitable folder on your hard drive.
2. Type in `chrome://extensions` in your address bar in Google Chrome.
3. Check the "Developer mode" checkbox at the top right of the page.
4. Click the "Load unpacked extension..." button, and select the folder that you created in the first step.

That's it! You should see a new Airtel logo next to your Chrome address bar. Click it to see details about your data usage.
